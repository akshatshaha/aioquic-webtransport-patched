# aioquic-webtransport-patched

> A patched fork of [`aiortc/aioquic`](https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic) with support for **WebTransport** on top of QUIC, intended for use in projects that require full WebTransport handling such as the [Nimble Challenge 2025](#).

---

## Purpose

This repository extends the official `aioquic` QUIC implementation with **WebTransport protocol support**, which is not yet officially available in the upstream.

The patch includes:
- `aioquic/webtransport/` module
- `WebTransportProtocol` class for datagram-based communication over QUIC
- Updated `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` to ensure installability via `pip`
- Fully compatible with existing `aioquic.asyncio` and `aioquic.quic` modules

---
